This project is a custom Python-based Port Scanner tool developed as part of a cybersecurity internship task.
The tool scans common TCP ports on a target system to identify open and closed ports, helping to understand basic network reconnaissance techniques.

The purpose of this task is to gain hands-on experience with network scanning and socket programming in Python.
